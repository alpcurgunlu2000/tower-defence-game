TASKS:
0) Intro task - Design idea of game and develop your virtual environment
- As an introductory step for the project, your task is to design the idea of a simple game that you can implement in the time frame of this project. The main focus of the game design has to be to create a scenario where different modalities inside of the game can be used, with though behind that combination of those modalities should be logical to a user or even better to make the gameplay easier for the user.
- Once when you have decided about your scenario and designed your idea, you can start creating your virtual environment inside of Unity*, and for that, you are encouraged to use free available assets in order to implement your design.
- Finally, it is important to mention that you are advised to implement your game to be exported for desktop. This is not a must, but if you decide to export it for any other device, the screen of the gameplay still has to be visible on your final presentation.
- *Unity is not a must, but all instructions are going to be written for it.
1) Task 1 - Implement first modality
- Following the idea of your game that you have created for intro task, in this week you should focus on implementation of interaction with your first modality.
- As it is not precisely defined which modality you have to use (in order that it fits with your own game design); it is important that during the final video presentation you state what modality have you chosen as “first” one. Further on, the task in the game also should be possible to complete by using only one modality.
- The results of Task 1 in your final video presentation should contain:
  - Short explanation of your game design and idea
  - Short explanation of what modality have you chosen for Task 1 and why have you chosen it
  - Video of game play where user is using only “first” modality
2) Task 2 - Implement second modality
- Similarly to the task of the last week, you should implement the second interaction according to your game idea.
- Again, it is not specified which modality to use, but it is important that it is different from the one that you have used for the Task 1. Those solution that will use the same modality for both tasks will receive points only for Task 1, even if you would use it in different scenes or scenarios.
- The results of Task 2 in your final video presentation should contain:
  - Short explanation of what modality have you chosen for Task 2 and why have you chosen it
  - Video of your game play where user is using “second” modality
3) Task 3 - Modality fusion & modality fission
- As in last two tasks you had to implement two modalities, in this week you will have to handel modality fusion and fission as following:
  - Modality fusion: trigger one action via two commands in two different modality channels. The commands have to represent a modality fusion (like the "put that there" example does).
  - Modality fission: you input two conflicting commands in two different modality channels. Find a solution on how to disambiguate the input.
- The results of Task 3 in your final video presentation should contain:
  - Gameplay video that shows your solution of modality fusion and the modality fission with short explanation for both solutions
4) Task 4 - Record presentation
- Record a small gameplay video that shows your implementation including the modality fusion and the modality fission.
- The video must be smaller than 20MB to upload it to ISIS (you can recode the video via ffmpeg / windows movie editor or a similar program to make is smaller).
